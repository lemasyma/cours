![](https://i.imgur.com/z7zqR0F.png)

## Choosing the optimal compute service
* The optimal compute service or services that you use will depend on your use case
* Some aspects to consider
    * What is your application design ?
    * What are your usage pattern ?
    * Which configuration settings wll you want to manage ?
* Selecting the wrong compute solution for an architecture can lead to lower performance efficiency
    * A good starting place: understand the available compute options

# Section 2: Amazon EC2
## Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
Example uses of Amazon EC2 instances:
* App server
* web server
* Database server
* Game server
* Mail server
* Media server
* Catalog server
* File server
* Computing server
* Proxy server

## Amazon EC2 overview
* Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
    * Provides *virtual machines* (EC2 instance) in the cloud
    * Fives you *full control* over the guest operating system (Windows or Linux) on each instance
* You can launch instances of any size into and Availability Zone anywhere in the world
    * Launch instance from **Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)**
    * Launch instances with a few clicks or a line of code, and they are ready in minutes
* You can control traffic to and from instances

## Launching an amazon EC2 instance
![](https://i.imgur.com/DmTue3H.png)

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert" markdown="1">
Nine key decisions when creating a EC2 instance.
</div>
### 1. Select an AMI
* Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
    * Is a template that is used to create an EC2 instance
    * Contains a *Windows* or *Linux* OS
    * Often has some software pre-installed
* AMI choices:
    * Quick Start
        * Linux and Windows AMIs provided by AWS
    * My AMIs
        * Any AMIs that you created
    * AWS Marketplace
        * Pre-configured templates from third parties
    * Community AMIs
        * AMIs shared by others; use at you own risk
 
![](https://i.imgur.com/c44uFKW.png)

## 2. Select an instance type
* Consider you use case
    * How will the EC2 instance you create be used ?
* The **instance type** that you choose determines
    * Memory (RAM)
    * Processing power (CPU)
    * Disk space and disk type (Storage)
    * Network performance
* Instance type categories
    * General purpose
    * Compute optimized
    * Memory optimized
    * Storage optimized
    * Accelerated computed
* Instance types offer *family, generation* and *size*

### Instance type naming and sizes
![](https://i.imgur.com/gZw3M91.png)

### Based on use case
![](https://i.imgur.com/dmrwck2.png)

### Networking features
* The network bandwith (GBps) varies by instance type
* To maximize networking and bandwith performance of your instance type
    * If you have interdependent instances, launch them into a *cluster placement group*
    * Enable enhanced networking
* Enhanced networking types are supported on most instance types
* Enhanced networking types
    * Elastic Network Adapter (ENA): Supports network speeds of up to 100 Gpbds
    * Intel 82599 Virtual Function interface: Supports network speeds of up to 10 Gbps

# Section 3: Amazon EC2 Part 2
## 3. Specify network settings
* Where should the instance be deployed ?
    * Identify the VPC and optinally the **subnet**
* Should a *public IP address* be automatically assigned ?
    * To make it internet-accessible

![](https://i.imgur.com/iGkPSkO.png)

## 4. Attach IAM role (optional)
* Will software on the EC2 insrance need to interact with other AWS services ?
    * If yes, attach an appropriate IAM Role
* An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that is attache to an EC2 instance is kept in an **instance profile**
* You are *not* restricted to attaching a role only at instance launch
    * You can also attach a role to an instance that already exists

## 5. User data script (optional)
* Optionally specify a user data script at instance launch
* Use **user data** scripts to customize the runtime environment of your instance
    * Script executes the first time the instance starts
* Can be used strategically
    * Reduce the number of custom AMIs that you build and maintain

![](https://i.imgur.com/BDZFCdy.png)

## 6. Specify storage
* Configure the *root volume*
    * Where the guest operating system is installed
* Attach *additional storage volumes* (optional)
    * AMI might already include more than one volume
* For each volume, specify:
    * The *size* of the disk (in GB)
    * The *volume type*
        * Different types of SSDs and HDDs are available
    * If the volume will be deleted when the instance is terminated
    * If *encryption* should be used

### Amazon EC2 storage options
* **Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)**
    * *Durable*, block-level storage volumes
    * You can stop the instance and start it again, and the data will still be there
* **Amazon Elastic Block Store**
    * Storage is provided on disls that are attached to the host computer where the EC2 instance is running
    * *If the instance stops, data stored here is deleted*
* Other options for storage (not for root volume)
    * Mount an **Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)** file system
    * Connect to **Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)**

### Example storage options
![](https://i.imgur.com/Zmr9PqP.png)

* **Instance 1** characteristics
    * It has an **Amazon EBS** *root volume* type for the operating system
    * What will happen if the instance is stopped and then started again ?
        * The OS volume would survive
        * Any data stored on Amazon EBS would remain intact
        * Any data stored in ephemeral volume 1 would be lost
* **Instance 2** characteristics
    * It has an **Instance Store** *root volume* type for the operating system
    * What will happen if the instance stops (because of user error or a system malfunction)?
        * All data stored in ephemeral volume 2 would be lost, including the OS

# Section 4: Amazon EC2 Part 3
## 7. Add tags
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
A **tag** is a label that you can assign to an AWS resource
* Consists of a *key* and an optional *value*
</div>
* Tagging is how you can attach **metadata** to an EC2 instance
* Potential benefits from tagging - Filtering, automation, cost allocation and access control

## 8. Security group settings
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
A **security group** is a *set of firewall rules* that control traffic to the instance.
* It exsists *outside* of the instance's guest OS
</div>

Create **rules** that specify the **source** and which **ports** that network communications can use.
* Specify the **port** number and the **protocol**, such as TCP, UDP or ICMP
* Specify the **source** that is allowed to use the rule

## 9. Identify the key pair
* At instance launch, you specify an existing key pair *or* create a new key pair
* A **key pair** consists of
    * A *public key* that AWS stores
    * A *private key* file that you store
* It enables secure connections to the instance
* For **Windows AMIs**
    * Use the private key to obtain the administrator password that you need to log in to your instance
* For **Linux AMIs**
    * Use the private key to use SSH to securely connect to your instance

## Amazon EC2 console view of a running EC2 instance
![](https://i.imgur.com/bvUS8HI.png)

## Another option: Launch an EC2 instance with the AWS CLI
* EC2 instances can also be created programmatically

``` bash
aws ec2 run-instances --image0id ami-1a2b3c4d --count 1 --instance-type c3.large \
--key-name MyKeyPair --security-groups MySecurityGroup --region us-east-1
```
This example shows how simple the command can be.
* This command assumes that the key pair and security group already exists
* More option could be specified 

## Amazon EC2 instance lifecycle
![](https://i.imgur.com/5L6u6Ef.png)

## Consider using an Elastic IP address
* **Rebooting** an instanc will *not* change any IP addresses or DNS hostnames
* When an instance will *not* change any IP addresses or DNS hostnames
* When an instance is **stopped** and then **started** again
    * The *public* IPv4 address and *external* DNS hostname will change
    * The *private* IPv4 address and internal DNS hostname do *not* change
* If you require a persistent public IP address
    * Associate an *Elastic IP address* with the instance
* Elastic IP address characteristics
    * Can be associated with instances in the Region as needed
    * Remains allocated to your account until you choose to release it

## EC2 instance metadata
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
It is data about your instance
</div>
* While you are connected to the instance, you can view it
    * In a browser: `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`
    * In a terminal window: `curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`
* Example retrievable values
    * Public IP address, private IP address, public hostname, instance ID, security groups, Region, Availability zone
    * Any user data specified at instance launch can also be accesse at: `http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/`
* It can be used to configure or manage a running instance
    * For example, author a configuration script that read the metadata and uses to configure applications or OS settings

## Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring
* Use **Amazon CloudWatch** to monitor EC2 instances
    * Provides near-real-time metrics
    * Provides charts in the Amazon EC2 console **Monitoring** tab
    * Maintains 15 months of historical data
* **Basic monitoring**
    * Default, no additional cost
    * Metric data sent to CloudWatch every 5 minutes
* **Detailed monitoring**
    * Fixed monthly rate for seven pre-selected metrics
    * Metric data delivered every 1 min

# Section 5: Amazon EC2 Cost Optimization
## Amazon EC2 pricing models
* **On-Demand Instances**
    * Pay by the hour
    * No long-term commitments
    * Elligible for the AWS Free Tier
* **Dedicated Hosts**
    * A physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use
* **Dedicated instances**
    * Instances that run in a VPC on a hardware that is dedicated to a single customer
* **Reserverd Instances**
    * Full, partial, or no upfront payment for instance you reserve
    * Discount on hourly charge for that instance
    * 1-year or 3-year term
* **Scheduled Reserverd Instances**
    * Purchase a capacity reservation that is always available on a recurring schedule you specify
    * 1-year term
* **Spot Instances**
    * Instances run as long as they are available and your bid is above the Spot Instance price
    * They can be interrupted by AWS with a 2-minute notification
    * Interruption options include terminated, stopped or hibernated
    * Prices can be significantly less expensive compared to On-Demand Instances
    * Good choice when you have flexibility in when your applications can run

### Benefits

|On-Demand Instances|Spot Instances|Reserved Instances|Dedicated Hosts|
|-|-|-|-|
|Low cost and flexibility|Large scale, dynamic workload|Predictability ensures compute capacity is available when needed|Save money on licensing costs </br> Help meet compliance and regulatory requirements|

### Use cases
![](https://i.imgur.com/MTwEnD8.png)

## The 4 pillars of cost optimization
![](https://i.imgur.com/o80PPDm.png)

### Pillar 1: Right size
* Provision instances to match the need
    * CPU, memory, storage and network throughput
    * Selct appropriate *instance types* for your use
* Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics
    * How idle are instances? When
    * Downsizze instances
* Best practice: right size, then reserve

### Pillar 2: Increase elasticity
* **Stop** or **hibernate** amazon EBS-backed instances that are not actively in use
    * Example: non-production development or test instances
* Use **automatic scaling** to match needs base on usage
    * Automated and time-based elasticity

### Pillar 3: Optimal pricing model
* Leverage the right pricing model for your use case
    * Consider your usage patterns
* Optimize and *combine* purchase types
* Examples:
    * Use *On-Demand Instance* and *Spot Instances* for variable workloads
    * Use *Reserved Instances* for predictable workloads
* Consider serverless solutions (AWS Lambda)

### Pillar 4: Optimize storage choices
* Reduce cost while maintaining storage performance and availability
* Resixe EBS volumes
* Changes EBS volumes types
    * Can you meet performance requirements with less expensive storage ?
    * Example: *Amazon EBS Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)* storage typically costs half as much as the default *General Purpose SSD (gp2)* storage option
* Delete EBS snapshots that are no longer needed
* Identify the most appropriate destination for specific types of data
    * Does the app need the instance to reside on Amazon EBS ?
    * Amazon S3 storage options with lifecycle policies can reduce costs

## Measure, monitor and improve
* Cost optimization is an ongoing process
* Recommendations
    * Define and enforce *cost allocation tagging*
    * Define metrics, set targets, and review regularly
    * Encourage teams to *architect for cost*
    * Assign the responsibility of optimization to an individual or to a team
