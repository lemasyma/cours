# What are the key challenges humanity has to face today ?
Proposed by students:
* Global warming
* Climate change
* Waste management
* Covid19
* Over consumption

### We are more than 7 billions. How many of us will there be in 2050?
* **Challenge #1 : population growth** : the population should stabilize at the end of the century, the growth rate is decreasing. In the last 40 years, the population doubled.
* **Challenge #2 : Consumption growth** : We are consumming more and more energy, goods, etc. We own more and more goods, want to get the newest technologies and throwing the old devices too often. It is the *linear economy* ![](https://i.imgur.com/38fz6Id.png)

* **Challenge #3 : Limited resources** : 
    * *Global overshoot* occurs when humanity's annual needs exceeds what Earth's ecosystems can renew in a year. It means we are drawing down the planet's resources rather than living off its annual interest. It leads to a depletion of Earth's life-supporting natural capital.
    * Our *ecological footprint* get bigger and bigger. If everyone lived like we do it France, we would need 3 Earths to feed everyone.
* **Challenge #4 : Global warming** : The *Greenhouse effect* is a natural phenomen, without it there would not be life on Earth. However, because of human activities, we are emitting more gases than necessary (CO2, CH4, etc.).
* **Challenge #5 : Biodiversity** : Currently there are more than 91,520 species on the IUCN Red List
    * more than 25,820 are *threatened with extinction*
    * including 41% of amphibians
    * 34% of conifers
    * 33% of reef building corals
    * 25% of mammals and 13% of birds

# Middle East has Oil, China has Rare Earths - Deng Xiaoping, 1992

## Context
More than 1 ton of resources is needed to produce a laptop. Precious metals, such as gold, silver, platinum, etc. can be found inside of a computer.

## Critical metals:
* Rare earths : China has more than 60% of rare earths, produce 88% and consume 69% of it. They are used in many electronic appliances, magnets, wind turbines, etc. 
* Cobalt
* Lithium
* Nickel

China owns 44% of those metals and is 58% of its demand.

:::warning
**However, these resources are limited. How can we continue to use them?**
:::

## Impact of rare earths extraction / production
* Environmental impacts
* Social impacts

## Solutions
* Open or re-open mines ?
    * Social acceptance
    * Environmental risks
    * ROI? 
* Finding alternatives ?
    * Reduce or do not use rare earths
    * Like tellurium and indium
        * CdTE solar PV  

# How to combine humanity development and sustainability ?
## The importance of biodiversity
* Aesthetic and scientific value
    * Medical research
    * Traditional and modern medicine
* Direct economic value
    * Food
    * Clothing
    * Energy
## Sustainable development goals
