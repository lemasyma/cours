# Section 1: AWS shared responsibility model
![](https://i.imgur.com/jut95PW.png)

AWS:
* Security of the cloud
* Physical facilities and system
    * Hardware, software for running AWS services

Customers:
* Securing app and datasets in the cloud
    * Data encryption in transit from one systeme to another
* Use Amazon Tools
* Network configured for security
* Firewall configuration and security of OS

## AWS responsability: Security *of* the cloud
AWS responsibilites:
* Physical security of data centers
    * Controler, need-based access
* Hardware and software infrastructure
    * Storage decommissioning, host operating, system (OS) access logging, and auditing
* Network infrastructure
    * Intrusion detection
* Virtualization infrastructure
    * Instance isolation
    * Between customers workloads

![](https://i.imgur.com/Jj0SBjo.png)

## Customer responsibility: Security *in* the cloud
Customer responsabilities:
* Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance *operating system*
    * Including patching, maintenance
* *Applications*
    * Passwords, role-based access, etc.
* *Security group* configuration
* OS or host-based *firewalls*
    * Including intrusion detection or prevention systems
* *Network* configurations
* Account management
    * Login and permission settings for each user

## Service characteristics and security responsibility
### Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
* Customer has more flexibility over configuring networking and storage settings
* Customer is responsible for managing more aspects of the security
* Customer configures the access controls

### Platform as a service (PaaS)
* Customer does not need to manage the underlying infrastructure
* AWS handles the operating system, database patching, firewall configuration, and disaster recovery
* Customer can focus on managing code or data

![](https://i.imgur.com/EIkdqRP.png)

### Software as a service (SaaS)
* Sofware is centrally hosted
* Licensed on a subscription model or pay-as-you-go basis
* Services are typically accessed via web browser, mobile app, or application programming interface (API)
* Customers do not need to manage the infrastructure that supports the service

# Section 2: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
* Use *IAM* to manage access to *AWS resources*
    * A resource is an entity in an AWS account that you can work with
    * Example resources; An Amazon EC2 instance or an Amazon S3 bucket
* *Example*: control who can terminate Amazon EC2 instances
* Define fine-grained access rights
    * *Who* can access the resours
    * Which resources can be accessed and what can the user do to the resource
    * *How* resources can be accessed
* IAM is a no-cost account feature

## IAM: Essential components
* IAM user
    * A *person* or *application* that can authenticate with a AWS account
* IAM group
    * A *collection of IAM users* that are granted identical authorization
* IAM policy
    * The document that defines *which resources can be accessed* and the *level of access* to each resource
    * Created independently than users and groups
* IAM role
    * Usefule mechanism to grant a set of permissions for making AWS service requests
    * Grant temporary access to a service
    * Similar to sudo in Linux

## Authenticate as an IAM user to gain access
When you define an **IAM user**, you select what *types of access* the user is permitted to use.

Can use either programmatic access, *AWS Management Console access*, or both.

### Programmatic access
* Authenticate using:
    * Acces key ID
    * Secret access key
* Provides AWS CLI and AWS SDK access

### *AWS Management Console* access
* Autheticate using:
    * 12-digit Account ID or *alias*
    * IAM user name
    * IAM password
* If enabled **multi-factor authentificatuin (MFA)** prompts for an authentification code

## IAM MFA
* MFA provides increased security
* In addition to user name and password, MFA requires a unique authentification code ot access AWS service

## Authorization: What actions are permitted
*After the user or application is connected to the AWS account, what are they allowed to do ?*
![](https://i.imgur.com/blY4RJ4.png)

## IAM: Authorization
* Assign permissions by creating an IAM policy
* Permissions determine **which resources and operations** are allowed:
    * All permissions are implicitly denied by default
    * Is something is explicitly denied, it is never allowed

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert" markdown="1">
**Best practice:** Follow the principle of *least privilege*.
</div>

Note: the scope of IAM service configurations is *global*. Settings apply accross all AWS Regions

## IAM Policies
* An IAM policy is a document in JSON that defines permissions
    * Enables fine-grained access control
* 2 types of policies
    1. *identity-base*
    2. *resource-based*
1. **Identity-based** policies
    * Attach a policy to any IAM entity
        * An IAM user, an IAM group or an IAM role
    * Policies specify;
        * Actions that *may* be performed by the entity
        * Actions that *may not* be performed by the entity
    * A single *policy* can be attached to multiple *entities*
    * A single *entity* can have multiple *policies* attached to it
2. **Resource-based** policies
    * Attached to a resource (such as an S3 bucket)

## IAM policy example
![](https://i.imgur.com/mybQH8w.png)

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert" markdown="1">
* Any actions not explicitly allowed are denied $\rightarrow$ out-of-the-box access are always deny (implicit deny)
* Any actions explicitly denied are always denied
* If there is a competition betwee an allowed statement and a deny statement, the deny statement always wins
</div>

## Resource-based policies
* *Identity-based policies* are attached to a user, group or role
* **Ressource-based policies** are attached to a resource (*not* to a user, group or role)
* Characteristics of resource-based policies
    * Specifies who has access to the resource and what actions they can perform on it
    * The policies are *inline* only, not managed
* Resource-based policies are supported only by some AWS services

## IAM permissions
How IAM deterines permissions:
![](https://i.imgur.com/O2jpHdH.png)

## IAM groups
* An *IAM group* is a collection of IAM users
* A group is used to granted by attaching IAM *policy* or policies to the group
* A user can belong to multiple groups
* There is no default group
* Groups cannot be nested

![](https://i.imgur.com/IHRlP9Q.png)

## IAM role
* An *IAM role* is an IAM identity with specific permissions
* Similar to an IAM user
    * attach permissions policies to it
* Different from IAM user
    * Not uniquely associated with one person
    * Intended to be *assumable* by a person, application or service
* Role provides *temporary* security credentials
* Examples of how IAM roles are used to **delegate** access
    * Used by an IAM user in the same AWS account as the role
    * Used by an AWS service (such as Amazon EC2) in the same account as the role
    * Used by an IAM user in a different AWS account than the role

### Example use of an IAM role
Scenario:
* An app that runs on an EC2 instance needs access to a S3 bucket

Solution:
* Define an IAM policy that grants read-only access to the S3 bucket
* Attach the policy to a role
* Allow the EC2 instance to assume the role

# Section 3: Securing a new AWS account
## AWS account root user access versus IAM access
* Best practice: **Do not use the AWS account root user except when necessary**
    * Access to the *account root user* requires logging in the the *email address* (and password) that you used to create the accout
* Example actions that can only be done with the account root user:
    * Update the account root user password
    * Changed the AWS Support plan
    * Restore an IAM user's permissions
    * Change account settings (for example, contact info, allowed Regions)

## Securing a new AWS account: Account root user
### Step 1: Stop using the account root user as soon as possible
The account root user has unrestricted access to all resources

To stop using the account root user:
1. While you are logged in as the account root user, *create an IAM user* for yourself. Save the access keys if needed
2. Create an IAM group, give it full administrator permissions, and add the IAM user to the group
3. Disable and *remove your account root user access keys*, if they exist
4. *Enable a password policy* for users
5. Sign in with  your new IAM user credentials
6. Store your account root user credentials in a secure place

### Step 2: Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)
* Require MFA for your *account root user* and for *all IAM users*
* You can also use MFA to control access to AWS service APIs
* Options for retrieving the MFA token
    * Virtual MFA-compliant applications
        * Google Authenticator
        * Authy Athenticator (Windows phone app)
    * U2F security key devices
        * YubiKey
    * Hardware MFA options
        * Key fob or dispLy card offered by Gemalto

### Step 3: Use AWS CloudTrail
* CloudTrail tracks user activity on your account
    * Logs all API requests to resources in all supported services your account
* **Basic AWS Cloud** event history is enabled by default and is free
    * It contains all management event data on latest 90 days of account activity
* To accces CloudTrail
    1. Log in to the **AWS Management Console** and choose the **CloudTrail** service
    2. Click *Event History* to view, filter and search the last 90 days of events
* To enable logs beyond 90 days and enable specified event alerting, create a trail
    1. From the CloudTrail Console trails page, click *Create trail*
    2. Give it a name, apply it to all Regions, and create a new Amazon S3 bucket for log storage
    3. Configure access restrictions on the S3 bucket (for example, only admin users should have access)

### Step 4: Enable a *billing report*, such as the AWS Cost and Usage Report
* Billing reports provide info about your use of AWS resources and estimated costs for that use
* AWS delivers the reports to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify
    * report is updated at least one per day
* The *AWS Cost and Usage Report* tracks your AWS usage and provides estimated charges associated with you AWS account, either by the hour or by the day

# Section 4: Securing accounts
## AWS Oganizations
* **AWS Organizations** enables you to consolidate multiple AWS accounts so that you centrally manage them
* Security features of AWS Organizations:
    * *Group AWS accounts into organizational units* (OUs) and attach different access policies to each OU
    * *Integration and support for IAM*: permissions to a user are the intersection of what is allowed by AWS Organizations and what is granted by IAM in that account
    * *Use service control policies* to establish control over the AWS services and API actions that each AWS account can access

### Service control policies
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
Offer centralized control over accounts: limit permissions that are available in an account that is part of an organization
</div>
<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert" markdown="1">
Not a subsitute for Identity and Access management configurations !
</div>
* In JSON
* Ensure that accounts compuly with access control guidelines
* SCPs are *similar* to IAM permissions policies
    * They use similar syntax
    * However, an SCP never grants permissions
    * Instead, SCPs *specify the maximum permissions* for an organization

## AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
* Enables you to **create and manage encryption keys**
* Enables you to control the use of encryption across AWS services and in your applications
* Integrated with AWS CloudTrail to log all key usage
* Uses hardware security modules (HSMs) that are validated by Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 to protect keys

## Amazon Cognito
* **Adds user sign-up, sign-in and access control to your web and mobile app**
* Scales to millions of users
* Support Sign-in with social identity providers, such as Facebook, Google and Amazon, and enterprise identity providers, such as Microsoft Active Directory  via Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0
* Help meet security requirementes

## AWS Shield
* is a managed distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection service
* Safeguards applications running on AWS
* Provides always-on detextion and automatic inline mitigations
* AWS Shield Standard enabled for at no additional cost. AWS Shield Advanced is an optional paid service
    * Available to all customers
* Use it to **minimize application downtime and latency**

# Section 5: securing data on AWS
## Encrytpion of data *at rest*
* **Encryption** encodes data with a *secret key*, wich makes it unreadable
    * Only those who have the secret key can decode the data
    * *AWS KMS* can manage you secret keys

* AWS supports encryption of *data at rest*
    * Data at rest = Data stored physically
        * Can encrypt any data supported by AWS key management service
    * You can encrypt data stored in any service that is supported by AWS KMS
        * Amazon S3
        * Amazon EBS
        * Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)
        * Amazon RDS managed databases

## Encryption of data *in transit*
* Encryption of **data in transit** (data moving across a network)
    * Transport Layer Security (TLS) (formerly SSL) is an open standard protocol
    * **AWS Certificate Manager** provides a way to manage, deploy and renew TLS or SSL certificates
* Secure HTTP (HTTPS) creates a secure tunnel
    * uses TLS or SSL for the bidirectional exchange of data
* **AWS services support data in transit ecryption**

![](https://i.imgur.com/y6Wsxyj.png)

## Securing Amazon S3 buckets and objects
* Newly created S3 buckets and objects are *private* and *protected* by default
* When use cases require sharing data objects on Amazon S3
    * It is essential to manage and control the data access
    * Follow the *permissions that follow the principle of least privilege* and consider using Amazon S3 encryption
* Tools and options for controlling access to S3 data include
    * Amazon S3 Block Public Access feature
    * IAM policies
    * Bucket policies: when can't log with IAM
    * Access control lists (ACLs): a legacy access control mechanism
    * AWS Trusted Advisor bucket permission check: a free feature

# Section 6: Working to ensure compliance
## AWS compliance programs
Customers are subject to many different security and compliance regulations and requirements

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
AWS engages with certifyin bodies and independent auditors to provide customers with detailed infromation about the policies, processes, and controls that are established and operated by AWS
</div>

Compliance programs can be brodaly categorized
* Certifications and attestations
    * Assessed by a third-party, independent auditor
    * Examples: ISO 27001, 27017, 27018 and ISO/IEC 9001
* Laws, regulations, and privacy
    * AWS provides security features and legal agreements to support compliance
    * Examples: EU *General Data Protection regulation (GDPR)*, HIPAA
* Alignments and framework
    * Industry- or function-specific security or compliance requirements
    * Examples: Center for Internet Security (CIS), EU-US Privacy Shield certified

## AWS Config
* **Assess, audit and evaluate the configurations of AWS resources**
* Use for continuous monitoring of configurations
* Automatically evaluate *recorded* configurations versus *desired* configurations
* Review configuration changes
* View detailed configuration histories
* **Simplify complicance auditing and security analysis**

## AWS Artifact
* **Is a resource for compliance-related information**
* Provide access to security and compliance reports, and select online agreements
* Can access example downloads:
    * AWS ISO certifications
    * Payment Card Industry (PCI) and Service Organization Control (SOC) reports
* Access AWS Artifact directly from the AWS Management Console
    * Under *Security, Identity \& Compliance*
* Accept agreements with AWS on multiple accounts
